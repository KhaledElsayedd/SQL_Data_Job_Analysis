# Background
### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, 
I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on jobs in Egypt. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg AS avg_yearly_salary,
    job_posted_date::DATE
FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short LIKE '%Data%Analyst%'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_location LIKE '%Egypt%'
ORDER BY avg_yearly_salary DESC;
```
